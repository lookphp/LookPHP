Pheasant Documentation
======================================

Pheasant is a bare-bones data mapper written specifically for PHP 5.3.1+ and MySQL. Rather
than focus on abstraction and rich feature sets, Pheasant focuses on a performance and
simplicity.

Despite it's small foot-print (<5k LOC), Pheasant packs a punch and offers:

 * Easy persistence for objects: create, update and delete
 * Property mapping for common types
 * Relationships: One-to-one, One-to-many
 * Fluid querying
 * Events system for extension
